# Texas Hold'em
### Summary

```shell
# index - hole_cards[index]

# LOOKUP â€” prints index, ordinals, facevalues for an index supplied in-file or as arg 1
node lookup_hole_cards.js

# GENERATE N games of N players where Player 0 plays with index specified as arg 1
node play_hole_cards.js 300 > data_300_1.json

# SUMMARIZE
node read_data.js data_300_1.json

# OR ... use do.sh
./do.sh
```
---- 

### *Suggestion*

Create an example by doing this:
1. Set players = 3 in play_hole_cards.js
2. Set i <= 1 in play_hole_cards.js (to play 1 game)
```
node play_hole_cards.js 78 > data_example_1.json
```


### Scenarios
Player 0 is dealt the specified hole cards N times in an N-person game. 

Define *bluff* in this context.
