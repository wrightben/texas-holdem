```shell
# index - hole_cards[index]

# LOOKUP â€” prints index, ordinals, facevalues for an index supplied in-file or as arg 1

### Suggestion

Create an example by doing this:
1. Set players = 3 in play_hole_cards.js
2. Set i <= 1 in play_hole_cards.js (to play 1 game)
```
node play_hole_cards.js 78 > data_example_1.json
```


### Scenarios
Player 0 is dealt the specified hole cards N times in an N-person game. 

Define *bluff* in this context.

as ah vs js jh	16804	**0.33608**<br />
js jh vs as ah	6601	**0.13202**<br />

### Conclusion

There are adults that make you want to have children. And children that make you want to kill them.

This completes a 35-year-long adventure in the contemplation of how to help a smart child accomplish something meaningful.

I hope it helps you.
